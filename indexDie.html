<p>With Emily Dickinson</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>I heard a Fly buzz - when I died -</p>
	<p>The Stillness in the Room</p>
	<p>Was like the Stillness in the Air -</p>
	<p>Between the Heaves of <a href="indexStorm.html">Storm</a> -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The Eyes around - had wrung them dry -</p>
	<p>And Breaths were gathering firm</p>
	<p>For that last Onset - when the King</p>
	<p>Be witnessed - in the Room -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>I willed my Keepsakes - Signed away</p>
	<p>What portion of me be</p>
	<p>Assignable - and then it was</p>
	<p>There interposed a Fly -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>With Blue - uncertain - stumbling Buzz -</p>
	<p>Between the <a href="indexLight.html">light</a> - and me -</p>
	<p>And then the Windows failed - and then</p>
<p>I could not see to see -</p>
