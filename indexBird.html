<p>With Emily Dickinson</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Bird, came down the Walk -</p>
<p>He did not know I saw -</p>
<p>He bit an Angle Worm in halves</p>
<p>And ate the fellow, raw, 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then, he <a href="indexFlood.html">drank</a> a Dew</p>
<p>From a convenient Grass -</p>
<p>And then hopped sidewise to the Wall</p>
<p>To let a Beetle pass -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He glanced with rapid eyes,</p>
<p>That hurried all abroad -</p>
<p>They looked like frightened Beads, I thought,</p>
<p>He stirred his Velvet Head. -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like one in danger, Cautious,</p>
<p>I offered him a <a href="indexCrumb.html">Crumb</a>,</p>
<p>And he unrolled his
	<a href="index.html">feathers</a>,</p>
<p>And rowed him softer Home -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Than Oars divide the Ocean,</p>
<p>Too silver for a seam,</p>
<p>Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon,</p>
<p>Leap, plashless as they swim.</p>
